Henja is a graphics editor for BasicGraphics (part of [BasicRender](https://github.com/igtampe/BasicRender)). It supports and can create both DrawFiles and HiColor DrawFiles (DF and HC respectively). While the editor is perhaps a tad basic, it beats having to do this by hand with no real preview.<br><br>

I use Henja to draw all the graphics I use in applications that use BasicRender, and decided to give it a touch up. Henja 3 is coded in C#, and uses the new BasicRender class library, rather than the VB.NET module. It's also got less bugs, and a better color picker for both DFs and *especially* for HCs.

**Quick Note:**<br>
Resizing is partially implemented. If you resize the window and want it to redraw, adjusted for the wider viewing angle, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <Kbd>R</Kbd>
